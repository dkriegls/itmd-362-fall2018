          <p>
            Students in this course will learn the importance of 
            human-computer interaction design and the effectiveness of user-centered design. The 
            course will cover a survey of methods frequently used by the HCI profession, such as 
            usability testing and prototyping, as well as general design principles and how to use 
            design guidelines. A particular emphasis will be placed on usability for Web site 
            engineering, and students will apply knowledge from the field in the design and 
            construction of user-centered Web sites. 
          </p>

          <h3>Course Overview</h3>
          <p>
            This course favors a mobile-first approach to web design and development, with special attention to the 
            challenges of designing touch-screen interfaces. Students will learn development methods based on prototyping 
            and rapid iteration, supported by version control and low-stakes user-testing. The design principles the 
            course will emphasize include color, material design, rich web typography, and responsive grid-based page 
            layout. Accessibility, progressive enhancement, and thoughtful, thoroughly researched use of edge technologies 
            and polyfills will be treated as guiding techniques throughout the course. Student work is organized around 
            projects of varying size and scale, emphasizing the course's hands-on, theory-grounded approach to web design 
            and development.

            the assigned date. These materials are a necessary and integral part of the class and 
            will form the basis for any class discussions on the topic. Specific readings are

            All major projects for this course will be submitted via Basecamp.
            Submissions should <b>not</b> include attachments, but rather URLs
            pointing to your project’s GitHub repository and live link.
            Examples will be demonstrated in class.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>All HTML and CSS in projects and lab submissions must pass validation</b> with the
            <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validator</a> and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3c CSS validator</a>.
            Any work whose HTML does not validate will receive a 50&#x25;-point reduction, failing grade. Get in the habit early of validating 
            each time before you commit your work to GitHub.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified
            in each project description.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will check to see that you are adding proper summaries of your GitHub commits. You are also expected to help other students on Basecamp. 
            This means polite give-and-take discussions of code. Do not discuss anything else on basecamp. Practice professional and supportive critiquing.

          <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
          <p>
            As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
            <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty">the Code of Academic Honesty</a>
            as described in the
            <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook">IIT Student Handbook</a>). All
            work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page
            design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
            open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
            legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage,
            dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the
            source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
            part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
            the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
            violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with
            a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Dean of the School of Applied
            Technology, who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting
            violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.
