f## ITMD 362 Lab 3: Form Styling and Web Fonts

For this Lab, build off the existing CSS, including its baseline grid and typographic (modular) scale, and design a mobile-scale form that
uses only shades of gray (no solid borders) for the input regions. Favor an open design with plenty of padding and white space.

Then, set up the `font-family` with a robust font stack (3 fonts deep) made up of commonly available system fonts. You might 
use a site like https://fonts.google.com to get yourself started.

* Finally, post a link to your Github repository for this lab to your Basecamp file.
