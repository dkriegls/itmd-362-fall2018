            <h4>Project Description</h4>
            <p>
              You will create a single-page design that features a sign-up process to get new
              users to join some type of project, such as an email list, a software beta test, or an
              open-source community. Focus on designing for an effortless, engaging entry of personal
              information; and friendly, frictionless client-side tests and alerts for malformed,
              missing, or incomplete information. The goal of this project is to experiment with
              patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is you’re
              offering, which is not at all an easy task.

              Some of the very worst designed websites you’ll come across are for banking, credit card
              payment, HR portals, and other non-optional websites for certain classes of customers or
              workers. Self-selected teams of 3 students will redesign this website. Additionally, you will
              add a compelling log in page, as if this were an on-line course for sale. Your redesigned should 
              employ sound principles of human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.

              The final project of the course asks you to subject your group’s redesign
              project to a series of low-stakes user tests, and to suggest improvements to the 
              website, based on what you learn through your user tests.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should structure your tests around the guidance in Chapter 9 of Krug’s book. You are
              welcome to use as a starting point his sample script and recording release
              form available <a href="http://www.sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html">at Krug’s
              website</a>. However, your script must be modified to match your specific project and
              tasks, obviously.

                Test your site with three different participants <b>not</b> in our class. At least one
                participant should use a mobile device (phone or tablet); at least one should use a
                traditional device (desktop or laptop)
              </li>
              <li>
                When possible, have participants use their own devices (but have a backup device ready
                to use)
              </li>
              <li>
                Figure out how to best involve online students in your group who cannot be present on
                campus for testing; include those details in your site plan
